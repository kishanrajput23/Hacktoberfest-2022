Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a
three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

Here we have built a simple beginner friendly tic tac toe website game using vanilla javascript, html and css. 
Some sounds and gifs are added for entertainment.

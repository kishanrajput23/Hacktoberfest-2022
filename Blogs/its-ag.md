# Wasting time? Get a skill. Love the art of writing code
_TL;DR, Coding is something that takes time, but hard work with great problem solving skills can make you something you want._

I am not going to say to you that everyone should learn code, it’s so easy and all those market tactics which are often used to manipulate the audience.  

In this article, I'm going to share some of the functional techniques that have helped me learn to code and *may* interest you to do the same.

## 1. Hard Work > Talent 💹
When I was in my 7th or 8th grade then I started using linux 👾 and have gained my interested in computers and how pograms really work, which further lead me to deep dive into coding and later I found web deveopement my thing.

Just like in studies hard work is more valuable than talent (talent is great if you have it and there are many developers out there where things just work on a much higher level) but programming is a skill very similar to playing a musical instrument 🎵 for most people you suck at first then you feel like a genius 🧠 when you code your first program then you realize you suck again and this pattern goes on and on forever in an infinite loop. ***In programming, you'll have to bang your head against the keyboard a bunch of times until you figure out how to make these error messages go away. 🪃***

## 2. Which Programming Language to learn first ?
> So you might be wondering which programming language should I start with ~ but the truth that it doesn't matter as long as you get really good at one of them.

The thing about** programming is that there's so much to learn**, you are never going to retain at all. I used to be a really good in python but at this point I've forgotten almost everything about it (because of Java Script) and that's no big deal 🥠 because memorizing the syntax doesn't matter, the thing you want to learn and retain are programming patterns essentially everything you do in programming is problem-solving the idea is to create a pattern of tools in your brain that you can then use to solve virtually any a problem in any language.

When you go to a the technical interview they usually don't care which language you use they just want to see that you know how to solve problems and in some cases they may only have you written pseudocode to analyze your problem-solving skills so in learning.

> I would recommend trying out a few different languages and learn the one that feels most natural to you for most people I think python is ideal because it has a minimal syntax and is extremely popular and is also just a very useful language to know in general but javascript, go, kotlin and swift are also good languages to start with but again it's about becoming a problem solver not about memorizing syntax.

## 3. How to become a problem solver? 🧠
> The answer is to solve a bunch of problems.

**Turn off youtube and go write some code.** Will you ever learn to play skateboard by watching other people with it, the answer is no you also need to be playing by yourself.

Tutorials are great but they're utterly useless if you're not coding along with them. In tutorials try to set you up with something cool to build so you can go have fun and fail on your own you can build things based on tutorials you can try to build your own stuff .

You can do coding challenges participate in *hackathons and all kinds of other stuff, if you're serious you should be coding at least a couple of hours every day. *

You can also join programming discord servers and learn with people out there or answer questions on stack overflow helping others feels good.

## Conclusion 🌳
Choose a topic like I want to program a video game do some research then **go and build something ‼** and get to a full working demo as quickly as possible it doesn't need to be perfect because in the final step you'll go back and refactor and simplify and find ways to improve your process and get feedback from someone more experienced.

*Learning is supposed to be painful but there also needs to be some kind of the reward 🍫 for that pain and the more quickly you can get those rewards (go build something 😮) the better because what you want is a the positive feedback loop that basically makes you addicted to coding 🎆.*

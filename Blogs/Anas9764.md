## What is frontend development?
- A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app. When you visit a website, the design elements you see were created by a front-end developer.

- Frontend developers are people who build amazing websites via code and markup text. Using frontend techniques and technologies, frontend developers can basically write websites from scratch or, what is more common today considering that it saves a lot of time, apply the design onto an existing theme and adjust it to the client’s needs.

- A frontend developer’s work entails writing the website code based on a PSD design file received from a web designer, thus creating the backbone of a website in HTML and styling it with CSS or adding smooth functionalities in JavaScript. Since websites are accessed from different devices and browsers, frontend developers make sure they are equally visible on all devices and across browsers with the power of responsive design and CSS stylesheets.

- The most commonly used frontend technologies in the creation of websites and web applications are the following:

# HTML
- HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.
- Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
- Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.
- Hence, HTML is a markup language which is used for creating attractive web pages with the help of styling, and which looks in a nice format on a web browser. An HTML document is made of many HTML tags and each HTML tag contains different content.

# CSS
- Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.

- CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.

- CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.
- CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

# JavaScript
- JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

- JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.

- The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.

- JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
 - Designed for creating network-centric applications.
- Complementary to and integrated with Java.
- Complementary to and integrated with HTML.

# Conclusions:
- In today's Web development, a good page design is essential. A bad design will lead to the loss of visitors and that can lead to a loss of business. In general, a good page layout has to satisfy the basic elements of a good page design. This includes color contrast, text organization, font selection, style of a page, page size, graphics used, and consistency. In order to create a well-designed page for a specific audience. The developer needs to organized and analyze the users' statistics and the background of the users. Although it can be hard to come up with a design that is well suited to all of the users, there will be a design that is appropriate for most of the audience. The better the page design, the more hits a page will get. That implies an increase in accessibility and a possible increase in business.

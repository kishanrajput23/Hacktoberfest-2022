Hello everyone, hope you all are doing well. I just now finished my interview so decided to write it down since it’s very fresh in my mind.
- First of all, she asked me “Tell me about yourself“.

I answered everything that I did till now in the first two years of my college life.
- Then she asked me about the computer fundamental subjects in the curriculum.
Since I had COA as my subject in the 3rd semester she asked me questions on that. One I answered and the other I wasn’t able to answer.
- Then she asked me what are the currently going on subjects in the running semester.
- A small talk and then she provided me the link of codility. She gave me a question on bit manipulation. I needed to build a function where a number was provided with a position. And according to that position we need to clear the bit of the given number. So the signature of the function was something like this:
### void clear bit(int num, int pos)
{  
}

- I tried to think a lot that what can be done and came to a solution but was not working. So, I changed my approach and decided to use bitwise and. Whatever came to my mind I discussed it with her. Then after working from scratch I was able to give a working solution.

- She was pretty chill, made me feel comfortable, and encouraged me if I was thinking right when I could make her understand what would my code look like if this approach could be done.

- After the correct working solution was done, she asked me if I had anything to ask. I asked a few questions and also for some advice.

That’s it. This was my experience. Thanks.

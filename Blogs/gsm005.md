Worms zone.io is one of the io game, which is the most addictive among all the io games. Its interface is also very catchy, interactive, and easy to use. Though all the io games consist of very basic tasks, so the players basically have an idea about what to do from the beginning we only have to prevent ourselves to touch other snakes. It does not take much time to master this game but the competition here is cutthroat. So after clicking on To battle! You can choose one from the three gameplay modes available: INFINITY, TIME, TREASURE HUNTER.
So let me share my experiences  

1. INFINITY
 It is the best mode in the game in which there is no time limit and the player can play until he gets killed. In this mode you will be left in an open ground with hundreds of other snakes and your only objective is to get the maximum weight of the worm. This mode kills your time without letting you know. It has many exciting powerups called potions which you can take to get different advantages.
Furthermore, if you have increased you size enough then you can make traps for other snakes by capturing them inside a circular cage by covering them inside you. Like this:

This game unlocks the extraordinary thinking you have. You will automatically be able to trap more than one snake if you play it daily. Personally, I like this mode very much. 

2. TIME
It is timed mode in which you have to survive in the ground till 7 minutes. In this mode you get double points and coin which is the best part. As you get double point so the chances of your winning also doubles. For those players who  love time limits in a game this mode is for you.
You can also easily increase your size in this mode as this is a fast paced mode so double points double fun!!

3. TREASURE HUNTER
To play this mode you need apples. You already have some apples or you can buy them with coins too. This mode is also a timed mode in which the round is of 5 minutes. This mode is a little different from other modes as in this mode obstacles are also introduced so protect yourself from those and open the treasure boxes as much as you can. the treasures are marked on the map. This mode also helps you to earn many coins.  So, play this round as you might have heard- less the time provided much more is the action. 

You can play this game both on mobile and directly in the browser in your laptop. Enjoy!

## Let's see about Biometric Technology

- The most well-known techniques include fingerprints, face recognition, iris, palm, and DNA-based recognition. Multimodal biometrics combines several biometric sources to increase security and accuracy.
- The future of biometrics will be adding facial, voice, or other types of biometric authentication to security for accessing sensitive data at work, applying for a bank loan, or using money management systems.

- In general, biometric technologies refer to the use of technologies to identify a person based on some part of their biology. Fingerprint recognition is one of the first and most innovative biometric technologies that has been informally classified as digital forensics.

- While we are in an era where technology is advancing at a tremendous pace, we are still able to replicate the physical capabilities of our bodies. Biometric technology, simply put, is the use of an individual's physical body to confirm identity.

- This technology has been used for a while, but has recently become more prominent.  With a greater use of technology in our everyday lives, it makes sense that biometric technology is becoming more popular.

- The worldwide security and cybersecurity market is facing a massive threat, owing in part to continued technical progress and constant digital change. Identity threats and dangers resulting from data breaches, cyberterrorist attacks, and so on are the primary forces driving market action.

- In my opinion. As a result, the growing need for security compels both developing and developed countries to employ the most dependable and strong biometric technologies

- Biometric technology or body recognition technology is being used more and more these days. More to the point, it is being used by more and more companies. And it's not just surveillance companies. It's also being used by sports teams and even by large corporations. It is also being used by private sector companies to try and bring in more efficiency. 

- Biometric recognition technologies have grown in importance in current society as a result of their convenience with recent informatization and network service diffusion
- Face recognition is one of the handiest and most practical of these technologies because it allows authentication from a distance without requiring any manual authentication activities. As far as we know, face recognition is vulnerable to changes in the look of faces caused by aging, lighting, and posture.

- There were some technical concerns that required to be addressed. Because of the emergence of deep learning technologies, great progress has recently been accomplished. This position paper provides an introduction to face recognition technology and introduces related applications such as face presentation assault detection, gaze estimation, person re-identification, and image data mining. 

- We additionally talk about the research issues that really need to be tackled and resolved. In an era where everything is connected and organizations are pushed by safety concerns from a wide range of sources, the optimization of biometrics for the majority raises concerns about their possible uses in diagnosis and treatment situations. 

- Viruses like the coronavirus already have caused a number of problems in 2020-21. Non-contact biometrics, such as palm veins and facial recognition, are key technologies that we could use in the future in scenarios like that to assist eliminate human interaction throughout any essential transactions without affecting cybersecurity.


## The Benefits of Face Detection and Recognition Access Control

- In contrast to key cards, which have significant drawbacks, facial recognition gives the most security and access authorization. Users merely need to present their faces to a scanner, and the system will establish their unique credentials and determine whether or not they are approved.

## These are the following Key Advantages of Biometric Technology :

### 1. Convenience

- To engage with the system, users do not need to carry actual access tokens. This is convenient for administrators and reduces the burden of adoption. Moreover, cloud authentication processes enable remote supervision, reduced vulnerability to localized problems, and smooth upgrades. Users only need to install the application & register using their mobile phone.

## 2. Integration

- The Face recognition technology is easy to integrate with current systems. Not only is the integration quick, but the smartphone, as well as cloud-based services that serve such biometric technology, also are knowledge that enables, practically everyone is already familiar with these interfaces.

## 3. Audit Trails

- Real-time updates are provided through cloud-based door access control. This makes things simpler to determine which user accessed which location and when. Additionally, this audit trail serves as a significant tool for research in the event of irregularities.

## 4. Covid19-Safety

- Contact-free access control is achieved via face recognition. Property builders must learn the skill of ensuring a hygienic atmosphere in the period of COVID-19. Avoiding the need to touch surfaces and permitting social distance is a sensible and hygienic approach. Both biometrics and access control technology has advanced greatly over time. The combination of the two technologies enhances these developments, bringing in a game-changing approach to building access control. With COVID-19 still in use, the combination of the two technologies has created an opportunity to optimize security and physical health.

### I believe that biometrics will dramatically improve daily living in the future, and also that its presence in our lives will become necessary.

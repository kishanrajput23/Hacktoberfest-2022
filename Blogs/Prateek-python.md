### 3. Codewars

--Coding is as much an art as a science, so it’s fitting that the Codewars platform would have a martial arts motif.

Once you’ve become a master, you can share your knowledge with other learners. ‌

### 5. CodeChef

--Competition can be the best motivator to learn, and CodeChef offers exactly that. This India-based platform is one of several that lets users measure their skills with challenging contests against other coders, which creates great coding practice for beginners. The competition is friendly, though, as participants often write posts and tutorials to help each other learn.

# 5 Browser Extensions for web devolpoment 

- The web browser you use to access the web (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.) can also be turned into a developer tool by way of browser extensions—downloadable add-ons that bring custom features to your browser. Here’s a look at some free browser extensions specifically applicable to web design.

### 1. WAPPALYZER

- Say you come across a wildly impressive site with features that you’d like to incorporate into a project you’re working on, but you can’t quite figure out how the site pulled it off. Wappalyzer(opens in a new tab) is a browser extension that uncovers the technologies used on websites, so you can see what makes those features run and use those tricks in your own work. Wappalyzer will detect content management systems (like WordPress), ecommerce platforms (Shopify, Drupal Commerce, Etsy, etc.), web frameworks (Ruby on Rails), and more.

### 2. WHATFONT OR FOUNT

- What happens when you run across a font you love but can’t quite place? Not keen on spending time trying to track it down? The WhatFont(opens in a new tab) browser extension allows you to inspect web fonts just by hovering over them, and it detects the services the fonts come from, too, so you can nab them for yourself. WhatFont is only compatible with Chrome and Safari, so if you’re using another browser you can try Fount(opens in a new tab).

### 3. PERFECTPIXEL

- When you’re working with images in HTML and CSS, it’s possible to lose some of the fidelity of your original design. Perfectpixel(opens in a new tab) lets you overlay your source JPG or PNG images over your web content, so you can compare the images pixel for pixel and create an HTML page that looks exactly like what you had in mind.

### 4. STYLEBOT

- Have you ever seen a site and wished you could make one tiny change— either due to special reading needs or because a different font would simply look better?? The Stylebot(opens in a new tab) browser extension lets you do just that. And for developers, it also lets you see how changes to CSS affect a website’s appearance for future reference in your own projects. Using a sidebar full of basic and advanced CSS options, you can change the appearance of sites you visit and even sync your saved styles across the machines you use.

### 5. CSS3 GENERATOR

- CSS3 Generator(opens in a new tab) is a browser extension that generates CSS3 (the latest version of CSS) code for a number of design features (text shadowing, columns, gradients, etc.). All you have to do is copy the generated code into your CSS and the feature will be in place.

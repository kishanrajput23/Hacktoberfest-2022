What is god ?


God is something that we don't know most of the peoples believe in god and do not .but today lets try to discover the theory of god. I know this is something strange because there is no theory available in our science world . but still I have something related to god maybe with scientific prove ..so let me ask you questions , do you believe in god oh maybe your answer is yes , so why do you believe in god , have you seen him ? how can you believe in something that you have not seen in your entire life ? ok let  me answer it, do . you believe in air, your answer is definitely yes air is the most important that an organism need to live ,but most of the peoples haven't seen air in theirs lives , do they ? but we can surely see air if we compress it .
here still a question left ,can we see god .ok ok I'll also answer it but for the peoples who do not believe in god, why do you not believe in god , I think your answer will be that how can you believe in something that you have not seen in your life or there is no prove and evidence of god in science .so lets start the theory of god . here i m taking that you know the basic knowledge of atom or space . atom is the smallest unit of matter or something that have mass and space is the area between an atom that there is nothing . more than 90 %of atom is space  if we clear all space of our earth , our earth will be fix in our hand . in every single spiritual book it is written that god is everywhere yeah this is true in our science, space is everywhere  . to understand god we just have to replace scientific words in science theories to spiritual words . space is the part of god .god is not a person or something that have shape . god is the mixture if so many things or phenomenon for example space blackhole , space electromagnetic waves , energy , neutron star etc. there are so many forces still left that we haven't discovered and still in dark .


Strongest force of universe


 according to science the strongest force of universe is nuclear force .but in neutron star electrons and protons does not present only neutrons are present . in neutron star gravitational is more than that of strong interaction  
 
 
Neutron star 


Neutron stars are formed when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses.  If the core of the collapsing star is between about 1 and 3 solar masses, these newly-created neutrons can stop the collapse, leaving behind a neutron star. (Stars with higher masses will continue to collapse into stellar-mass black hole.  nasa research


Relation of god with neutron star and exceptions 


so what happened to electrons and protons in a neutron star? where have they go?
in neutron star electrons and protons collapses together by gravitational force by overlapping strong nuclear force . they convert as neutrons . but sometimes strong interaction force leads on and electrons and protons opposes each other with a great force that they got separated so lets try come back to our real question what really god is . god is the power that controls exceptions . god is nothing but the greatest force and greatest energy of the universe that is not understandable by humans till right now . mostly humans say god to things or phenomenon that are difficult to understand but helps them directly and indirectly  by their minds . for example in ancient cultures sun , moon and many planets are gods . but after the discoveries of space now many of religious people do not think them as god . in reality god exist in this universe and that is the source of all energy in this small universe . there are so many particles that are so small and can cross our earth  known as neutrinos . Neutrinos have surprised scientists many times in the past. But at this time they are not completely discovered . 


 True self of god ( the real definition )
 
 
many peoples and many religious books believe that we can find god in inside us , yes that is true we can understand god through our mind and the soul of our body . god is only source of all energy that stabilize all universe or maybe many universe and every single part of universes by making both positive and negative changes in our environment , galaxy ,universe as well as our lives . he can not interfere in our lives directly but he can give you power to complete any difficult task . actually he does not give power to us that power is inside us we just have to discover it . our religious books are the way to find that power and to active your soul that is inside your insecurities. but all things are not correct in religious books . you have to change words and even sentences to grasp the real information given in that books . god is no one but still a person we can talk , talking with god is really good for your health because your sub conscious mind feels like somebody is there for your help and to love you . you are not all alone , this is why most of the the monks, saints and fathers do not get into the metal health problem . you can even get confidence by talking to god .

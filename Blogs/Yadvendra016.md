## Blockchain
Blockchain is an *ever-growing ledger* that keeps a permanent record of all transactions on a network in a secure and *chronological order* which cannot be changed or tempered.

### Form the Definition
1. **An Ever-growing Ledger **  Which means it's just a file that is going to store information on all the transactions that are happened and going to happen in the future.
2.  **Permanent Record ** All the information that is stored in blockchain will be permanent and can not be changed or hacked.
3.  **A Secure Record ** It uses a highly very advanced cryptography method to secure the data.
4.  **Chronological Order ** Data is stored in chronological order which means over time the transaction happened to help the information and network tampered proof which makes it non-hackable

### BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON BLOCKCHAIN
Before blockchain internet works on  [Client-Server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model#:~:text=Client%2Dserver%20model%20is%20a,and%20service%20requesters%2C%20called%20clients.&text=Examples%20of%20computer%20applications%20that,and%20the%20World%20Wide%20Web.> ) In old client-server model Network be failed in one computer then the whole server starts not working, to fill this gap Blockchain technology used. 

Blockchain runs on **Decentralised Systems of Nodes** Nodes or Centralised computers spread all over the world. All nodes host and run blockchain programs. In Blockchain information is not stored in one computer it passes through thousands of nodes computer. It is virtually impossible to hack the blockchain. Information stored in Blockchain cannot be changed.

## MINORS 
Minors are group around the world that forms the Blockchain Network which runs the Bitcoin Ledger. Manage all  Data stored in form of blocks. Miners solve cryptographic maths problems by finding [Crypographic nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce).

Every 10 minutes a new block is added which contains information on all transactions that happened in the last 10 minutes. Blocks are linked chronologically.

### SHA256 HASH
**SHA256 ->** SECURE HASH ALGORITHM a fixed size of 256bits.

SHA256 HASH function is a part of a set of Cryptographic functions developed by the National security Agency(NSA).

**Hash ->** A digital fingerprint of a set amount of data a bunch of alphanumeric characters that identify with a certain amount of Data.

### PROPERTIES OF SHA256 HASH
- Always fixed length.
- Hash with the same data will always be the same.
- SHA26 is one-directional we cannot generate text from the hash.
- Small changes in data make a significant change in hash.

## WHAT IS BITCOIN
- Bitcoin is a digital asset (like physical asset gold, land, etc).
- It is used as a digital currency.
- No middle man is required like a bank for transactions. It transaction is done by peer to peer.
- Technology that is used to build Bitcoin is Blockchain.
### How Bitcoin Work
- Bitcoin is a piece of software this software defines what is bitcoin? How to transfer it? Validity and Invalidity.
- Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency so it depends on cryptography to regulate the transfer of bitcoin between parties and to regulate the creation of Bitcoin.
- To run the bitcoin it needs a computer and processing units(hardware) that is where *minors* come into space.

#### PROCESS OF ADDING A BLOCK INTO BLOCKCHAIN
The software generates Cryptographic Maths problem every 10 minutes challenge is to find [Nonce number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce) to find the valid Hash number. In this step **Minors** comes into action all minors compete with each other to find the exact nonce number, the computer generates Billions of numbers where one number satisfies nonce. Once any minor find the correct number then all other minors verify it, If the number is correct then the minor is awarded a certain amount of bitcoin.

## APPLICATION OF BLOCKCHAIN
1. **RELIABILITY** Blockchain can never fail because it has no single point of failure.
2. **SMART CONTRACTS** 

-> Exchange of value without a middleman.

-> No Escrow Service 

-> Blockchain acts as a witness.

-> Identity and other Private information are Anonymous.

3. **ETHEREUM** (creator - Vitalik Buterin)

It is open-source software that uses smart contract technology for the development of applications 
to develop a Blockchain network plug and play into Ethereum Blockchain a virtual currency called **Ether** that is used to pay for using Ethereum network.
## LIMITATION OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY
1. It is an Early Stage the knowledge is still vague.
1. Lack of awareness.
1. Lack of developer - since it is a new technology very few know about blockchain.
1. Some applications may require modification which is not allowed in the blockchain.
1. It takes time and energy to process.

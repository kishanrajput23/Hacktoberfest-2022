# Tools of AWS Security
AWS Security provides you a view of your security alerts and security posture to your AWS accounts. There are powerful security tools that provides from firewalls and endpoint protection to vulnerability and compliance scanners.

According to AWS Security tools, you now have one & only place that aggregates, organizes your security alerts, or findings, from multiple AWS services. The tools are as follows:

## 1. AWS Shield:

This amazon security tool is a DDoS protection service that provides security on Amazon EC2, CloudFront, Global Accelerator, and upload balances. As DDoS protection may not seem complete. However, AWS still states that about 99% of all AWS Shield infrastructure flood attacks are usually reduced in less than a second to CloudFront.

Additionally, attacks are often organized to prevent a particular company from running its business. The AWS Shield that allows you to stay awake even without having to photograph your security team is something that can give you a competitive edge. The AWS shield can also protect online websites, which can be hosted within Amazon Web Services. In short, AWS Shield is a tool that will keep your resources accessible at an unparalleled level of success.

## 2. Amazon GuardDuty:

This Amazon GuardDuty is a cover-up service that detects threats and is very easy to use. Also known as a wall watcher. Amazon GuardDuty analyzes your logs across all your resources and accounts to ensure that nothing is left unsafe. Amazon GuardDuty may also detect activities linked to account corruption, for example, compromise, and review.

This will include various features such as Data Retrieval, Disable Login Attempts, Unusual API Calls, Hole Scanning and malware. As a result, this service is designed to be a ‘manual lock’ tool. Therefore, you cannot write custom alerts yourself.

## 3. AWS Inspector:

AWS Inspector is a security judgment tool that detects risk and analyzes AWS applications. The best feature about this service is that the controllers will be receiving the corresponding upgrades reviewed by the AWS security team. Establishing security quality and compliance with the distribution of applications and the foundation gives the organization an amazing start to security. The best thing about this tool is that it is compatible.

## 4. CloudWatch:

Amazon CloudWatch is a viewing and management service that provides data and operational data for AWS, hybrid, and local applications and building services. CloudWatch provides services that can help you compile and provide access to all your work and active data in the form of logs and metrics from a single location.

CloudWatch can also help you identify security issues. In addition to applications for security purposes, this tool can summarize app usage and performance data. CloudWatch is also used to adjust EC2 scenarios to automatically remove or add computer resources to ensure that organizations get the most out of their investment in AWS services.

## 5. Prowler:

Prowler is a third-party or mediator service that is reported as the best AWS test, investigation preparation, defense, and testing tool. Prowler is a good deal with a stop scanner, in which an open source community is developed. Contains 98 pages covering designated areas, such as network, identity management (NIM), and provisions relating to the Health Insurance and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the General Data Protection Act (GDPR).

## 6. Macie:

Macie is an ML (Machine Learning) based service, which constantly analyzes data access trends and scans and detects abnormalities to mark unauthorized data access and data leaks. The main purpose of this Macie tool is about data protection and storage. It can send alerts to CloudWatch to capture all custom and automated alerts. Unless it is a fully managed service, you should find it much easier and more efficient to add more visibility and alertness without having to do extra work. Currently, it only supports S3 bucket analysis. It also allows companies to know whether their important data is compromised or not.

## 7. ScoutSuite:

ScoutSuite is also a great research tool, like Prowler but there is a big difference between the two services that ScoutSuite is a multi-platform or cross-platform hosted by Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud Platform.

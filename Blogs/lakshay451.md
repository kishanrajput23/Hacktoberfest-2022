 - "Security of a seed is not in just remaining in its shell, but to break its boundaries and to grow into a full fledged tree."

 - Almost all our life we are looking only for security whether we realize this or not. Most of our decisions whether related to education, profession, or social relations, we also look for options which are safe and followed by many others. We struggle so much, just to ensure our security but still we are afraid all our life and thus we fear from any kind of challenging situation.

 - Real security is the one which gives us the strength to accept any kind of challenge in our life. It makes us almost fearless and enables us to tackle any situation in our life.

 - This can only come when we strive to move out of our comfort zone and push ourselves to the next level. There is a great joy in moving out of our limited boundaries and living with challenges.


 - Most of us are always afraid of taking challenges, instead we choose to be on the safe side and remain in our comfort zone. This is because of the survival tendencies of human being . With a challenge also comes some danger and some risk. We have to improve ourselves in the process of accepting any challenge and getting out of our comfort zone.

 - Remaining in our comfort zone is like becoming a stagnant pool which is no good. The nature of life is to flow in every situation. 
Only a dead person is very comfortable with everything, living things always change and grow with time. If one is truly alive then he would not hesitate to accept challenges.

 - "Anything with doesn't kill you makes you stronger"

 - This gives immense strength and fearlessness because we are not afraid of any challenge and the most important thing is we are open to life. This gives immense joy and happiness and we start to just flow with life.

 - Although goal setting is very important to accomplish short term targets in our life but we should not see our life as a goal or a race. The famous dialogue - "Life is a race" is a stupid philosophy because if life is a race then we must reach the finish line as soon as possible but no one wants that.

 - Whatever goals we would set for ourselves would be in the limitation of what we already know. It is not wise to spend our life on what we already know instead we must explore new possibilities. For small things we can set goals such as getting good marks in an exam etc but for our life we must not set a goal .

 - Then what should we do??

 - We need to focus on just one thing which is to improve ourselves everyday.

 - Everyday we must ask ourselves- Am I better than yesterday?? We must make sure that its answer should be yes.
If we improve ourselves regularly then naturally we would reach our true potential and that is what really matters in life.
By the end of the day we must be a little more joyful, more physically fit, more enhanced, a little better.
This is the way by which we can be interested, active and involved in every moment of our life.

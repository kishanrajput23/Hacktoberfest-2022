# Benefits Of Networking

### 1.Why Is networking with people necessary?

There’s no denying in the power a strong professional network can have over our career success. Networking helps us to develop and improve our skill set and stay on top of the latest trends in the industry and job market.

Networking also helps to advance our career and give access to more job opportunities.

Expanding our contacts can open doors to new opportunities for business, career advancement, and personal growth.

Exchanging information, advice, and support on challenges, experiences, and goals is a key benefit of networking because it allows us to gain new insights which may have not thought of it otherwise.

### 2.Getting a Job becomes easy if You have a strong network!

Have you ever wondered why some people seem to have it so easy when it comes to getting a job while others have to submit dozens of applications before they can even get a reply? It’s all about networking. People who are aware of networking and are good at it have easy access to job openings. Looking for a job is like trying to sell a product; the difference is that we are the product here and it’s our skills that are for sale.

It is no secret that a lot of hiring is done through personal connections, such as friends and acquaintances. Because of this, we will never get to hear of a job opportunity unless we know an employer or someone in the same field. Employers place a considerable preference for candidates who they personally know and can trust.

### 3.Create win/win situations!

It's very important that both you and the other party gain equally when networking. If you benefit more than the other person, he or she will feel cheated and used. When that happens, you won't be able to go back and build a long-term relationship.

### 4.Give before you receive!

In networking situations, people expect you to ask them for help. If you turn that around and just offer some support, your networking partner will be grateful and want to return the favor.

### 5.Taking care of the network!

A successful network must be balanced, meaning we should give as much as we take. If we ask for someone's help or use a contact for our gain, make sure we are ready to give back when called upon. This requires trust from both parties, so we should link ourself with people whose reputation and ethics we believe in. Chances are good they feel the same way about us.

It is not enough to just have someone on the email list or have them as a friend on social media; a true working network requires maintenance. We should send our contacts some personalized updates every now and then. Offer up our help if we can. Meet for coffee just to catch up and see how the other is doing. Putting in a little effort can go a long way. Also, do not be afraid to ask for help as we have chosen to have these people in our network for a reason.

<h2>GSSOC : Open Sourceâ€¦.a journey not a destination..!!</h2>
<br>
 One of the amazing things that happened to me this summer was the gssoc. Well, I applied for it thinking it shall look good on Linkedin or resume, little did I know it would bring about so many changes in my perspective towards open source and coding. Being a First year, offline college starting, it was so difficult to juggle between contributing and college studies and Iâ€™d say I could have done better time management. But nevertheless, atleast Iâ€™ve learnt where I need to improve on!
 <br><br>
 I had first read about gssoc on someoneâ€™s Linkedin profile, and honestly at first, mistook it for Gsoc tooðŸ˜…. But then as I searched about it, I was quite sure I wanted to apply to such a program that can help me work on so many different projects at the same time. I majorly contributed in web development projects using html, css, javascript since I was well-versed in those languages. I wish I had more time to learn python in detail, machine learning since it had awesome projects related to it. Iâ€™ll make sure I do it next year or maybe this winter. Iâ€™m not much interested in blockchain or nft, but Iâ€™ll surely explore related projects next time as they did seem interesting later. I loved contributing in projects where we had to make frontend templates or website clones. Apart from that, there were projects like video chatting app, faceX an app that detects your face, Iot related project that has various projects related to arduino, raspberry pi, some mental heath awareness, environmental awareness projects.

 The project admins had a vision, mentors had dedication and contributers were needed to work hard in order to make the projects and thus the program successful. And yes we all did it! 10000+ Prs is not a small thing. It shows how enthusiastic this program has made us contributers.
<br>
 It is an emmense happiness when a pr where you as contributer put your sweat, blood, tears gets merged. It is really sad when a pr for which you worked so hard is rejected due to unfortunate circumstances. <b>However, one thing Iâ€™ve learnt is open source is not a destination, but a journey! One which Iâ€™ll continue experiencing and cherishing forever!<b>

It’s 6 in the morning, and  you wonder why the alarm clock is buzzing earlier than usual. It’s not a malfunction though: the smart clock  had scanned your schedule and adjusted automatically because, you know, you’ve got exams in the morning. Your shower turns on and warms to your preferred temperature. The health sensors embedded in your bathroom detect signs of an illness and place an order for medicines. Good thing you still ace the exam. That is the utopian version of the smart home in the coming future. All thanks to **Internet of Things**.

For those who don’t know yet, **IoT, in simple words, means taking all the (physical) things in the world and connecting them to the internet**. The development in this field has been primarily driven by large companies. According to market-research company IoT Analytics, there are already 7 billion connected IoT devices. In terms of opportunities, I feel IoT has a great future.

Obviously, there are some key issues  related to  the delivery  of IoT  services. These include  Universal connection, operation on  low power  devices,  security  and  privacy  issues, etc. All the devices that are connected to the Internet are like a meal for hackers. When we’re talking about devices that can unlock our homes from far off or collect our personal data, cybersecurity will play a major role. **If security concerns such as confidentiality, privacy, authenticity are addressed, the transformation of IoT to IoE (Internet of  Everything) will  be possible  in near  future**. This is an area of concern which I think is going to affect this industry, because if there are people who have the brains to make these things work, there are also people who are able to crack/hack it.

We all have used Google Assistant in our phones, haven’t we? In the future, these AI platforms could act as the brain for entire building. IoT company Crestron, for example, is working on software that tracks a person’s habits, like which music they want to listen or which lights they want to be on at night. Then, once it gets the hang of their preferences, it automatically plays just the right playlists or dims the lights before bedtime. This sounds really crazy to me.

**Speaking of opportunities**, the technology reached 100 billion dollars in market revenue for the first time in 2017. The forecasts suggest that this figure will grow to around 1.6 trillion by 2025. The global market for Internet of things (IoT) solutions grew to 212 billion U.S. dollars in size by 2019.

For proper implementation of IoT in  real life  it takes  around 5-10  years from  now. In my opinion, *the future of IoT is countless small, low-powered devices that provide real-time insights into everything that’s important to a company*.  It has  all the tendencies, but it’s up to the user how technology is applied. I am excited as well as scared to witness this growth. I hope we don’t get to witness a real-life Terminator movie! I am optimistic that we can use IoT to build a future that amplifies human potential.
